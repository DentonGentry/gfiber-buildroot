# tlsdate is great for security, because it validates the SSL certificate
# of the server you query.  But it's not so great for precision, because
# the TLS-based timestamp it uses is only accurate to the nearest second or
# so.
#
# Thus, we use tlsdate to initially sync the clock to about the right time,
# then make a second jump using NTP to get it slightly closer, and finally
# use djb's clockspeed tool to trim the clock rate to it stays in sync.
#
# The clockspeed docs suggest adjusting clockspeed (using an NTP server
# for example) once at the start, again after a few hours, again after
# a few days, and again after a few weeks, and again after a few months.
# Some quick testing suggests that the code is at least good enough to keep
# millisecond level accuracy for hours at a time.  So let's use very long
# delays between syncs.

MAX_ADJUST_SECS=10800     # max seconds between clock adjusts, once synced
MAX_RETRY_SECS=30         # max seconds between clock adjusts, after error
ADJUST_BACKOFF_FACTOR=3   # multiply backoff timer by up to this much
