# There are two kills to log-delay here.  In the common case log-loop
# will be waiting in sleep.  In the uncommon case an upload happening,
# and taking a long time for example if the server is busy.  In tis
# case we will kill the pending upload, then we wait a bit to make
# sure that the log loop has gotten to its sleep call, and then we
# kick the log-loop again to make sure the latest logs are uploaded.
# Worst case we upload logs 2x.
