Subject: [PATCH] serial: RS485 ioctl structure uses __u32 include linux/types.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In the commit below a new struct serial_rs485 was introduced for a new
ioctl:

    commit c26c56c0f40e200e61d1390629c806f6adaffbcc

	tty: Cris has a nice RS485 ioctl so we should steal it

This structure uses the __u32 types for some of its members, which leads
to the following compile error:

    $ cc -I.../include -c X.c
    In file included from X.c:2: .../include/linux/serial.h:185:
		error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘__u32’
    $

It seems that these types are appropriate for this structure as it is
to be exposed to userspace.  These types are available via linux/types.h
so move the include of that outside the __KERNEL__ section.
