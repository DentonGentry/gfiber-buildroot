# When building a target filesystem, it is desirable to not have to become
# root and then run 'mknod' a thousand times. Using a device table you can
# create device nodes and directories "on the fly".
#
# This is a sample device table file for use with genext2fs. You can do all
# sorts of interesting things with a device table file.  For example, if you
# want to adjust the permissions on a particular file you can just add an
# entry like:
#   /sbin/foobar        f       2755    0       0       -       -       -       -       -
# and (assuming the file /sbin/foobar exists) it will be made setuid root
# (regardless of what its permissions are on the host filesystem.
# Furthermore, you can use a single table entry to create a many device
# minors. For example, if I wanted to create /dev/hda and /dev/hda[0-15] I
# could just use the following two table entries:
#   /dev/hda    b       640     0       0       3       0       0       0       -
#   /dev/hda    b       640     0       0       3       1       1       1       15
#
# Device table entries take the form of:
# <name>    <type>      <mode>  <uid>   <gid>   <major> <minor> <start> <inc>   <count>
# where name is the file name,  type can be one of:
#       f       A regular file
#       d       Directory
#       c       Character special device file
#       b       Block special device file
#       p       Fifo (named pipe)
# uid is the user id for the target file, gid is the group id for the target
# file.  The rest of the entries (major, minor, etc) apply only to device
# special files.
