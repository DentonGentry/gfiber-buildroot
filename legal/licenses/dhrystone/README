 *              Original Version (in Ada) published in
 *              "Communications of the ACM" vol. 27., no. 10 (Oct. 1984),
 *              pp. 1013 - 1030, together with the statistics
 *              on which the distribution of statements etc. is based.
 *
 *              In this C version, the following C library functions are used:
 *              - strcpy, strcmp (inside the measurement loop)
 *              - printf, scanf (outside the measurement loop)
 *              In addition, Berkeley UNIX system calls "times ()" or "time ()"
 *              are used for execution time measurement. For measurements
 *              on other systems, these calls have to be changed.

 *      Please send results to Rick Richardson and/or Reinhold Weicker.
 *      Complete information should be given on hardware and software used.
 *      Hardware information includes: Machine type, CPU, type and size
 *      of caches; for microprocessors: clock frequency, memory speed
 *      (number of wait states).
 *      Software information includes: Compiler (and runtime library)
 *      manufacturer and version, compilation switches, OS version.
 *      The Operating System version may give an indication about the
 *      compiler; Dhrystone itself performs no OS calls in the measurement loop.
 *
 *      The complete output generated by the program should be mailed
 *      such that at least some checks for correctness can be made.
