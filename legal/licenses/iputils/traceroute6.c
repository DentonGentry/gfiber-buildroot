/*
 *	Modified for Linux IPv6 by Pedro Roque <roque@di.fc.ul.pt>
 *	31/07/1996
 *
 *	As ICMP error messages for IPv6 now include more than 8 bytes
 *	UDP datagrams are now sent via an UDP socket instead of magic
 *	RAW socket tricks.
 *
 *	Original copyright and comments left intact. They might not
 *	match the code anymore.
