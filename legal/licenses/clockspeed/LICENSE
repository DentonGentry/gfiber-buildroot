Frequently asked questions from distributors

This page is for people who want to distribute copies of my software or
derivative works: for example, an operating system that includes the
software.

You don't need to read this page if you simply want to use my software. You
are free to download the software from my web server; you then own that copy
of the software, and you are free to compile it and run it.

You also don't need to read this page if you simply want to set up a mirror
of my web pages.
