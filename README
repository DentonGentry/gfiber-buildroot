To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make'
2) wait while it compiles 
3) run './UMlinux' to test out your root filesystem using User Mode Linux.

You do not need to be root to build or run this system.  Each Virtual Terminal
will be opened in its own window.  You must be running X and have xterm
installed for this to work -- otherwise you see a few errors on bootup as it
tries to launch xterms.   It will still work on a console, but you will not
have access to the other Virtual Terminals.

Also, you the uClibc and busybox source trees that
are downloaded are fully set up for anonymous CVS access.  You may need to set
up your system for anonymous CVS access by running the following command:

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@busybox.net:/var/cvs login

Then just hit Enter when it prompts you for a password.  You only need to do
this once.  Then, whenever you want to update your system, just go into the
busybox or uClibc directory and run 'cvs update'.

Have fun!

NOTE:

    For './configure' to behave itself with certain applications, you may need
    to create a symlink under "/lib" on your system that points to the uClibc
    shared library loader in the staging directory.  For example, on my system

        $ cd /lib
	$ sudo ln -s /home/andersen/buildroot/build/staging_dir/lib/ld-uClibc.so.0 ld-uClibc.so.0

    If you don't use sudo, run 'su -' to become root when making the link.  If
    you aren't root it won't work.  The reason for this symlink, is it allows
    './configure' to actually execute the test applications it compiles against
    uClibc during the configuration process....
