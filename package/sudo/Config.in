	  Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give
	  limited root privileges to users and log root activity.  The
	  basic philosophy is to give as few privileges as possible
	  but still allow people to get their work done.

	help
	  Restrict the use of the sudo command to the root user.
	  Especially on embedded systems it can be desirable to not
	  allow unprivileged users to acquire root access. Still sudo can
	  be useful on such systems to allow the root user to launch
	  daemons/programs with a different uid. The restriction is
	  enforced through file system permissions.
