	  Iperf was orginally developed by NLANR/DAST as a tool for measuring
	  maximum TCP and UDP bandwidth performance. Iperf allows the tuning
	  of various parameters and UDP characteristics. Iperf reports
	  bandwidth, delay jitter, datagram loss.

	  iperf3 is a new implementation from scratch, with the goal of a
	  smaller, simpler code base, and a library version of the
	  functionality that can be used in other programs. iperf3 has also a
	  number of features found in other tools such as nuttcp and netperf,
	  but were missing from iperf2.x.

	  Some new features in iperf3 include:

	   * reports the number of TCP packets that were retransmitted
	   * reports the average CPU utilization of the client and server (-V flag)
	   * support for zero copy TCP (-Z flag)
	   * JSON output format (-J flag)

	  Note that iperf3.x is not backwards compatible with iperf2.x
