	  Prelinking is the process of pre-computing the load addresses and link
	  tables generated by the dynamic linker as compared to doing this at
	  runtime. Doing this ahead of time results in performance improvements
	  when the application is launched.

	  By providing an emulated runtime dynamic linker, the cross-prelink
	  project extends the prelink software's ability to prelink a sysroot
	  environment. Additionally, the cross-prelink software enables the
	  ability to work in sysroot style environments.
