Subject: [PATCH] genregdb.awk: db.txt actually doesn't include an antenna
 gain parameter.

The db.txt from the wireless-regdb.git project only includes (xx) or (xx mW)
in parens after each frequency range, referring to the maximum EIRP, not the
antenna gain.  The code was previously parsing that value into the antenna
gain slot and leaving maximum power set to zero, causing vastly reduced
power levels.
